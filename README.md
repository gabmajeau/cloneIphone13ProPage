# Apple iPhone 13 Pro Clone

This project is a simple **clone of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro webpage**, created to practice **JavaScript**.

### Main feature

JavaScript allows you to **change the displayed iPhone color** when clicking the color buttons. The script removes the `selected` class from the previous button and adds it to the clicked button, updating the image accordingly.

### Demo
